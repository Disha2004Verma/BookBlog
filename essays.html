				<p>Though we aren’t quite sure how the school year will look this year due to circumstances surrounding COVID-19, there’s one thing for sure: we are headed back to school in only a few months. While the summer does feel like it has flown by, I for one, am excited to dive into a new year full of education and learning.</p>

				<p>But once your kids are headed back to the classroom, what are you going to do with any time you might have away from work? This year, why not focus on learning more as a parent, adult, and friend with these incredible reads that will help you self educate? These reads will help you set your children up for academic success (a must during every school year!) or hone in your own skills to become a more educated adult. No matter what your education goals are this coming year, these books for back to school will certainly help you get there.</p>

			<div class="ebox3"><h3>Book and Booze.</h3><p>I’m always looking for fun ways to liven up my book clubs, and recently I’ve been really into incorporating themed foods and drinks into the event. In my opinion, it makes the book club experience even more memorable when you can eat a slice of homemade bread with Laura Ingalls while reading Prairie Fires or indulge in a Gin Rickley with Jay Gatsby while reading The Great Gatsby.</p>

			<p>If you’re looking for an immersive experience to share with the members of your book club, pairing your books with a special treat is definitely the way to go. That’s why I rounded up eight of my favorite book & booze combinations. Serve one of these cocktails at your next club for a sure-fire hit.</p>

How else could Hermione have found a book about the one and only Nicholas Flamel in the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts Library during year one of their wizarding education? Or when Matilda Wormwood needed something special to read to get away from her horrible parents? Both of these characters heavily relied on an awesome book organization system, and if you love to read as much as they do, why not get your shelves in order? Doing so will make your book shelf even more accessible so that you can find something right when the mood strikes.</p>
            <p>Here are a few ways to organize your bookshelves.</p>

We love them, and we hurt them. And they have fascinated writers for hundreds of years – from their ability to express human emotion to their ability to survive the harshest parts of mother nature. In fiction, animals propel the story forward, save the hero or end up being the ultimate protagonist. In non-fiction, behavioralists, ecologists and other scientists offer up data and evidence about the animal kingdom that often reveals more about us humans than usually intended. Whatever you’re looking for, this list is an indulgence for animal lovers of all kinds.</p>

			<div class="ebox6"><h3>Books with suspense.</h3><p>2020 has been an excellent year for horror. And it makes sense if you think about it. With all of the horrifying things happening all around the world, it’s been nice (at least for me) to escape into fictional horror this year. I don’t know what it is about horror that’s so comforting. Maybe it’s knowing that things could always be worse. Or maybe it’s the validation of seeing what horrible things would be like if all of our worst fears came to fruition. All of that sounds really bleak. But really. Thank goodness for the best horror books of 2020. There are so many horror novels out this year that are worth a read, but here are 16 new horror novels for 2020 you definitely won’t want to miss.</p>
